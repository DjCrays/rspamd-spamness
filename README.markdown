Spamness
========

This is a Thunderbird add-on for visualizing SpamAssassin scores generated
on the server-side and embedded in message headers.  It does NOT actively
run SpamAssassin in any meaningful way, nor will it.

You should acquire it from [addons.mozilla.org][1].  Thanks to the hard
work and commitment of folks at [BabelZilla][2], the add-on is available
in a wide variety of localizations.
