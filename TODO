Unrelated: observer / broadcaster for archive key...? might fix issue

NEW FEATURES
- figure out how to make rules the twisty openable kind and make each one a link to the wiki
- prefpane: nicely change custom column/custom db header when pref changes (is this possible with the instant thing? set an observer on the pref?) and prompt to rebuild index; maybe do that on unfocus...; make re-indexing button do something
- refresh view when preferences are accepted with prefs observer
- deal with instant vs. hit a button - ondialogaccept is easier to manage the pref mods than
- check on windows, especially prefwindow height
- see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Adding_preferences_to_an_extension

EVALUATE
- Logarithmic categorization - good enough or too coarse?  Is it possible
  to manipulate the size+opacity within TB to avoid having to make those
  graphics?

MARKETING
- Make a logo
- Make a better, monochrome column header

DEFER
- Change column display to be just graphic with score vs. threshhold as tooltip [seems impossible]
- Move the junk score columns to a separate extension [or not, not that useful]
