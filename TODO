For 0.6:
- write a new XBL binding <mail-multi-urlfield>
 - figure out how to make rules toggle-able
 - get the score for each rule, sort by descending value (make configurable?)
 - make each one a link to the wiki, opening in a new content tab

- warn on install to rebuild index with a .xul
 - globally enable column on install

- prompt to rebuild index on pref change

- make re-indexing button do something or take it out

- refresh view when preferences are accepted with prefs observer - use invalidate on tree.columns.[column].invalidate()
- see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Adding_preferences_to_an_extension

For the future:
- allow for more than one header string
- Make getImageSrc have a side effect (sigh) of setting the tooltiptext of the cell at row, col.  Change column display to be just graphic with score vs. threshhold as tooltip [seems impossible] - maybe register onmouseover on the entire tree; if getCellAt returns the appropriate column, tooltip it...
