NEW FEATURES
- Incorporate into message display, preferably as actual score vs. threshhold
- Change column display to be just graphic with score vs. threshhold as tooltip

EVALUATE
- Logarithmic categorization - good enough or too coarse?  Is it possible
  to manipulate the size+opacity within TB to avoid having to make those
  graphics?
- Anything worth turning into user preferences?

MARKETING
- Better representative graphics instead of circles?
- Finalize a logo
