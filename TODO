Unrelated: observer / broadcaster for archive key...? might fix issue

NEW FEATURES
- check if reindexing needed at all in 3.0 - didn't seem to be, looked like it indexed a lot already
- enable column on install
- warn on install to rebuild index
- Make getImageSrc have a side effect (sigh) of setting the tooltiptext of the cell at row, col.  Change column display to be just graphic with score vs. threshhold as tooltip [seems impossible] - maybe register onmouseover on the entire tree; if getCellAt returns the appropriate column, tooltip it...
- preference onblur fails to run...
- refresh view when preferences are accepted with prefs observer - use invalidate on tree.columns.[column].invalidate()
- check functioning on windows, especially prefwindow height
- options for showing score (actual score, actual score+thresh, normal score, etc.)
- figure out how to make rules the twisty openable kind and make each one a link to the wiki - write a new XBL binding that makes a textarea instead of just an HTML input
- allow for more than one header string
- prompt to rebuild index on pref change; maybe do that on unfocus...; make re-indexing button do something
