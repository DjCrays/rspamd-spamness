Unrelated: observer / broadcaster for archive key...? might fix issue

NEW FEATURES
- refresh view when preferences are accepted with prefs observer
- check functioning on windows, especially prefwindow height
- options for showing score (actual score, actual score+thresh, normal score, etc.)
- figure out how to make rules the twisty openable kind and make each one a link to the wiki - write a new XBL binding that makes a textarea instead of just an HTML input
- allow for more than one header string
- prompt to rebuild index on pref change; maybe do that on unfocus...; make re-indexing button do something
- see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Adding_preferences_to_an_extension

MARKETING
- Make a logo (0.3)
- Make a better, monochrome column header (0.3)

DEFER
- Change column display to be just graphic with score vs. threshhold as tooltip [seems impossible]
- Move the junk score columns to a separate extension [or not, not that useful]
